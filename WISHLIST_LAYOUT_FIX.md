# ‚úÖ Wishlist Layout Fix - No Dashboard Required!

## Problem:
The wishlist pages were using the dashboard layout (`<x-layouts.app>`), which showed the admin sidebar and required users to navigate through the dashboard interface. This was confusing for regular users coming from the home page.

## Solution:
Created a new simple layout (`<x-layouts.wishlist>`) that uses the home page navbar style instead of the dashboard sidebar.

---

## Changes Made:

### 1. **New Layout Created** ‚úÖ
**File**: `resources/views/layouts/wishlist.blade.php`

Features:
- Simple home page style navbar
- Sticky header
- No dashboard sidebar
- Clean footer
- Same navbar as home page (Home | Books | My Wishlist | Request Book | Dashboard)

### 2. **Updated Wishlist Views** ‚úÖ

Changed from `<x-layouts.app>` to `<x-layouts.wishlist>`:
- ‚úÖ `resources/views/wishlist/index.blade.php`
- ‚úÖ `resources/views/wishlist/create.blade.php`

---

## What This Means:

### Before:
```
User clicks "Request Book" ‚Üí Redirected to Dashboard layout with sidebar ‚Üí Confusing!
```

### After:
```
User clicks "Request Book" ‚Üí Simple page with home navbar ‚Üí Easy to use!
```

---

## Navigation Flow Now:

### From Home Page:
1. User sees "Request Book" button in navbar
2. Clicks it
3. Opens **simple form** with same navbar as home page
4. User can easily navigate back to Home or Books
5. No dashboard sidebar

### From Dashboard:
1. User can still access "My Wishlist" from sidebar
2. Opens with **same simple layout** (consistent UX)
3. Can navigate to Dashboard if needed
